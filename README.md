# Liri-Bot

This program uses node and javascript.
NPMs used are request, spotify, axios, moment, and DotEnv. 
## Commands 
* movie-this 
* concert-this 
* spotify-this-song  
* doThis 
## Directions
To make this app run, open the terminal in liri.js and make sure you are in the Liri-Bot file. When you are there, type in node liri and one of the commands above using the exact same syntax as written above. After you type in those commands, type in either a movie name, a band or singer's name, or song name. 
Typing in doThis will pull information from the random.txt file which is spotify-this-song, "I Want it That Way" and therefore run the spotify-this-song command.
